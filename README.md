# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI (Desktop)
 An AI based Tic Tac Toe game.  
 There are 3 modes:  
 1. Hard: You will play against an AI that uses the Minimax Alpha Beta Pruning Algorithm to make the best move possible. You won\'t win, the best thing you can do is a tie!  
 2. Easy: You will play against an AI that randomly chooses its next move.
 3. 2 Players: You can play with your friend in a friendly game of Tic Tac Toe.
